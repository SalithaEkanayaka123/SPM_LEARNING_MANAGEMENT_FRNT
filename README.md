This repository contains the front-end React project of the Learning management system.

#### System Overveiw

Assignment based on an online tuition management system. Students can subscribe to the services and use the material that is provided by the online system. The system will manage several units including tutors, modules, materials of modules (Downloadable) schedules, and more. Students will drop the initial one-time payment to subscribe to a module. Once unlocked the module permission will remain forever with the authenticated user. They can go through materials, download the attached documents and stream attached videos.

When an unregistered user comes into the system he/ she can only see the overview of the system and to see the fully functional system user has to register to the system. If the user is a student, the student has to register on the student registration page and if the user is a teacher, the teacher has to register on the teacher's registration page. To navigate to the system user has to login in relevant login  pages. When navigating in each login system admins make sure to avoid unauthorized users accessing the system by relevant user authentications and validations.

When Student logs into the system, the student can see the classes, courses and materials but he/ she has been restricted from accessing them by relevant validation until payments are done. In the student profile page students can see the details of the student that is given to the system following with payment history of each student of each payment he/ she has done. In teacher’ profile page the teacher can have the personal details for the teacher the same as the student.

Users point of view there are two types of users as tutors and students, However admins and the systems technicals are exceptions as they don’t directly associate with the system.

Tutors can publish modules or courses with their materials. Tutors will get paid once students enroll in the module. These courses can be updated by the tutors overtime. They can add new content to the modules or else they can even revoke already published modules in the system.

Once a registered student enrolled in a course by paying. That course permission will be retained forever for that student. They can see the progress that they are making in these courses. Another advantage here is that they can send their problems and issues as inquiries to the tutors which are in charge of each course.

As for the course materials there are attachments such as PDF documents and worksheets, Also they can stream online attached lectures inside the course.

Payment handling system is already mentioned above. Basically it will calculate and pay the tudors based on how many students have bought their courses. Some proportion of this amount will be dedicated for the system expenses and the rest will be allocated as the tutor fee.
